# Korprulu Finance

This landing page is for a fictional finance company written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The challenge is to make a web page with only the three basic code files: index.html, style.css, and script.js to practice raw web fundamentals.  No frameworks, external links, or packages are used.  100% hand-coded.  No copypasta or AI.  

The page may be viewed here:
